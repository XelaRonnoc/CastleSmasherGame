Strange in how explosions would destroy the wall in the same way as solid projectiles (big chunks of splintered wood)","Strange in that solid projectiles would usually cause the base to break before blowing a hole through the surface especially with cannon ball (projectile 4). Realistic in that an angled hit from a solid projectile would bounce off without much damage, and explosion damage was mostly as expected.","Realistic in how the bricks would fall from solid projectiles, and they way they sprayed from explosions. Strange in cohesion of bricks after the entire wall falls as a block, the base more likely to break before the rest of the surface. ","Feels like a heavy solid object, that also breaks apart on impact, fairly accurate and straightforward. Can also bounce off debris or other projectiles.","A little bit strange, explosion strength was tricky to judge at first. First hits on the wooden surface would have little impact, subsequent impacts would completely destroy it. Also the small projectile would occasionally seem to go through a solid surface. ","A little trickier to use, as it is a heavier object as well as exploding, which means it could topple the wall or roll further away before exploding. A well placed hit was especially satisfying with brick spray though. ","Also a little confusing, sometimes more destructive than expected, sometimes less. Mostly expected to behave like a faster stronger rock (projectile 1), but damage impact would sometimes be strange.","Impact bomb going through a seemingly solid surface, moving the camera through a wall immediately destroys it but only when upright (debris do not interact with movement) ",Falling off the stage was funny. Trying trick shots was fun.

Much more to do with the wall itself rather than the projectile.",Some of the explosions would lag the machine (but that might be because I was spamming the trigger),"The thicker walls seemed to be the most consistent, the thinnest walls would work if it was glass for instance, but otherwise stick to the thicker walls.

Although the initial impact felt grounded in reality, it often shattered from the bottom and then the rest of the wall just flipped over as one unit","The crumbling of the bricks were fairly realistic, if a bit lego-like in how they broke apart. When shot with higher-velocity projectiles it had disproportionate force in its explosions","Fairly weak on the tougher ones, but largely realistic","felt more like a large bullet than a bomb, often erred more towards cartoonish in how high-energy the explosions were","irritating to interact with due to the roll effect without much ground friction, but created satisfying impacts. Occasionally the effects were a little too high intensity to be realistic, like with the bricks",The most cartoonish. Even though its high velocity its destruction felt sometimes disproportionate,a few times with the medium concrete wall the red timed explosive just disappeared through the wall and exploded behind it,"Very cool project, I think balancing parameters and adding more nuanced shattering for the bricks especially would go a long way"

Concrete felt a bit strange with its breakage due to it not shearing like real world concrete. and the chunks broke too easily into smaller pieces.,Bricks broke realistically into large chunks and further into smaller chunks. explosives felt a little cartoony due to bricks flying and shattering too extremely.,Blue projectile felt good having a low impact force compared to the others however the size felt too large for anything with real-world relatability. ,Felt amazing with how it impacted immediately. explosive force felt a bit excessive. ,"It being a ball made it functionally annoying to use and its explosive radius was massive which affected nearby walls. the explosive was excessive (could be intended), obliterating all the walls.",Felt amazing having a fast-moving projectile with high force made perfect dents in walls. ,None,None
