# CastleSmasherGame
A 3D Destruction Based Game built using Unreal Engine 5. Currently in a very early state with a basic level system, menu, objectives, highscore, and destruction.
The intention is to make a fully simulated physics game where the player commands a peice of seige equipment such as a cannon and knocks down the castle. 
Utilising Unreal's Chaos Destruction to facillitate the castle destruction allows for enhanced real time destruction and physics simulation for various
materials and projectiles.
